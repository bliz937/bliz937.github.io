I have a [Raspberry pi 2 b](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/) which I use as my Linux machine.
I would, from my windows laptop, ssh into the pi.

## My problem
I would connect to the pi using the wired lan and the auto IPv6 addressing would enable me to ssh without needing to do any form of network setup.
From my windows machine, I could ping the pi's IPv6 address. However, from the pi, I could not ping the windows machine via IPv6.
Turning off the firewall did not help.

I even tried to ping using specific arguments such as specifying the device and IPv6 protocol.

## My fix
I noticed that when running ```route``` on the pi, I only had routes for the wireless nic.

```bash
[root@pluto ~]# route -v
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
default         gateway         0.0.0.0         UG    303    0        0 wlan0
192.168.1.0     *               255.255.255.0   U     303    0        0 wlan0
```

I then did a quick search on how to add an IPv6 route for the ```eth0``` interface.
My first result lead me to [tldp.org](http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Linux+IPv6-HOWTO/x1183.html).

Running the rule

```bash
route -A inet6 add default dev eth0
```

enabled me to ping the windows machine from the pi.

TL;DR: Could not ping from the Pi using IPv6. Had to manually add IPv6 route to routing table.
