A friend needed to copy a file from a distant remote site using a [VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) connection to his machine.
He noticed that the transfer speeds were maxing out at around 200KB/s, when the connection to the Internet is far greater than that, on both sides.
His ingenious trick was to split the file into multiple parts and copy the parts over simultaneously onto different machines. This did the trick somewhat but I wanted an easier and faster solution.

## My problem
How to copy files over VPN faster than the limitation we see.

## My fix
Doing some reading, I discovered that some other people faced a similar issue: [here](https://forums.juniper.net/t5/ScreenOS-Firewalls-NOT-SRX/2-NS5GTs-Site-to-Site-VPN-slow-file-copy/td-p/156854) and [here](https://forums.juniper.net/t5/SRX-Services-Gateway/Slow-route-based-site-to-site-VPN-connection-between-SRX240-and/m-p/33241).
The one fix was to change the [MTU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_transmission_unit) as the second link above had one set to too high a value and was causing fragmentation.

On windows to [view the MTU](https://superuser.com/questions/37686/how-to-tell-what-mtu-is-being-used-in-windows-xp#answer-317914), open up Powershell or cmd and write

```powershell
netsh interface ipv4 show subinterfaces
```

You should see an output similar to this

```powerhshell
MTU  MediaSenseState   Bytes In  Bytes Out  Interface
------  ---------------  ---------  ---------  -------------
4294967295                1          0    3127521  Loopback Pseudo-Interface
1500                1  5942108670  1169076382  Local Area Connection
1500                5          0    4151914  Local Area Connection 2
1500                1          0    1895684  VirtualBox Host-Only Network
```

You can see the MTU in the first column. An MTU of [1500 is the standard](https://supportforums.cisco.com/discussion/9211546/why-mtu-size-1500).

This was not the problem.

A [Stackoverflow](https://serverfault.com/questions/322641/how-much-throughput-should-i-expect-to-lose-over-a-vpn-connection) post on how much network loss should be expected from using a VPN mentions that CIFS/SMB is sensitive to latency. This looked like it's the cause, but we need to test this.

I used [iperf](https://iperf.fr/iperf-download.php) to test the network bandwidth between the two machines.

Running

```powerhshell
.\iperf3.exe -s
```

on machine A (the server), and

```powershell
.\iperf.exe -c a.b.c.d
```

on machine B (the client) - where ```a.b.c.d``` is the IP of machine A.

This is a sample output of what you should get

```powershell

Running ```iperf``` on a machine by the remote site and one locally showed that it was actually the connection been limited. We found that the connection itself was being limited. Here is a nice article on using iperf: [link](http://www.slashroot.in/iperf-how-test-network-speedperformancebandwidth).
