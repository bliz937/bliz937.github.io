Doing some C# coding, I wanted to install Visual Studio 2013.

## My problem
The installer opens fine and proceeds to install, after some clicks.
It appears to be stuck at applying a hotfix for windows; KB2664825.


Some sites, [example](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/vstudio/en-US/57e30c3e-edff-464b-9087-a065c92ad112/hotfix-for-windows-kb2664825-catastrophic-failure-installing-vs-2012?forum=vssetup), recommend turning off the AV and disabling Windows update.

## My fix
I turned off the AV and the Windows update service. However, I noticed from previous times that Windows update automatically starts up again. So during the installation, if the progress bar appeared stuck, I simply disabled the service again.

TL;DR: Visual Studio stuck installing, disable Windows update multiple times in services.
